I am fortunate enough to be in the first [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com) Remote Prep class! The course is 4 weeks long, meeting 5 days a week for 3 hours.

The class time has flown by, and I have been able to work and get to know a majority of my classmates! I had wondered what it would be like to pair program remotely with people, and I honestly think it is just as good as if the person was sitting beside you.

The first week was spent learning Markdown, HTML, and CSS.

#### Markdown

The first night was a 'get to know the class' where each person [interviewed their paired partner](https://gist.github.com/jrzimmerman/4bc55dd20ae8206689c0) and then had to introduce their partner to the class. We styled the information with Markdown.

#### HTML

The second night focused on learning HTML and [deploying our first site](http://jzimmerman.divshot.io/)! This was a great experience. Since I knew some HTML already, the instructors hinted at using Bootstrap to style the site. I was also able to use the command line to deploy my website using [Divshot](https://divshot.com/). One of the cool things about the Remote Prep class, is that the instructor and TAs are always willing to push you when you ask for extra material.

#### CSS

The third night was more difficult for me. I am probably the least exposed to CSS, and I was able to learn so much from the exercises. We also focused on importing media to websites such as YouTube videos, Google Maps, sound files, and external sites.

#### Forms

The fourth night was all about styling multi-page web sites and learning how to use forms in HTML. We also discussed GET and POST, and [how the internet works.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc)

#### CSS Frameworks

The fifth day was all about advanced styling of layouts with CSS and an introduction to modern HTML and CSS frameworks! I am excited to be using [MinimalCSS](http://minimalcss.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) from this point forward.

I hope to continue posting what I have learned from class on a weekly basis! Happy learning!
