It's finally that time! After completing the pre-course work, I start my journey with Hack Reactor today.

I plan to write on a weekly basis about the new topics covered, and what was focused on during my time here at Hack Reactor.

During the pre-course we focused on gaining a firm understanding of web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and jQuery.

Programming concepts such as scope, execution contexts, objects, and recursion were discussed in great length.

I am so excited to start my journey into Software Engineering with Hack Reactor!
