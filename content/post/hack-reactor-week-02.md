Week 2 is over already, what a great time it has been! I was able to settle in this week and make progress on some awesome projects.

#### Inheritance Patterns

The beginning of week 2 focused on JavaScript inheritance patterns. We discussed the pros and cons of functional classes, functional-shared classes, prototypal classes, and psuedoclassical classes.

#### nQueens

If you don't know about this problem, check it out! It's an especially fun logic puzzle, where you have to test for a given amount of queens, on an (n x n) chessboard, how many solutions can you find? This problem was a conglomeration of all the concepts we had previously discussed to this point. The solution involves the create of a 'decision tree' and anything with the word 'tree' in it, will certainly benefit from the use of recursion.

#### d3

This has been my favorite project so far. We were tasked to create a game using d3. Coming from a previous job where visualization of data is so important, this was such a great sprint. I was able to apply my knowledge of data visualization and coordinates to create a super fun game that I really enjoyed!

Sorry these posts keep getting shorter! I'm looking forward to week 3!
