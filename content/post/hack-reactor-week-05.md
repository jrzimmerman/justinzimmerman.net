With another week completed, week 5 has been extremely interesting. The topics this week included authentication, and deployment, along with introductions to MongoDB and Angular.

#### Authentication
As we all know, security is a pivotal part of development. Authentication is the act of verifying that your user is actually who they say they are. This verification normally includes a username and password. When that password is passed to the server we then return a token for return authentication requests.

#### Deployment
Learning deployment has been very fun, and I have really enjoyed leveraging services like [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) to make deployment easy as possible. Along with deployment, we talked about using build task runners such as Grunt and Gulp.

#### Angular
Angular is an excellent framework that I was able to work with at the end of the week. Unlike Backbone, Angular is quite opinionated, in a good way. Angular has thorough documentation, and has promises built in, to handle callbacks.

With only one more sprint next week, the transition to group project phase begins!
